+++ {"part": "abstract"} 

High-resolution characterization is a hallmark of materials research, enabling the correlation of structure and dynamics across length scales.
Computational diffractive imaging -- the use of algorithms to reconstruct a signal from non-directly interpretable diffraction data -- has revolutionized high-resolution characterization and holds particular promise in dose-efficient imaging for both materials-science and life-sciences samples. 

In this talk, I will formulate diffractive imaging as an inverse scattering problem and introduce some of the algorithms I have developed to solve this inverse problem efficiently, drawing examples from reconstructions in magnetic textures and plunge-frozen proteins. 
The interactive exposition will showcase the open-source science-communication tools I have been developing for a recently launched, online, open-access journal.
