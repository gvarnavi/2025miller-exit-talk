## Transfer of Information

- Different phase retrieval methods &rarr; different transfer of information
  - these can be modeled analytically/numerically and inform experiments!

```{figure} ./figures/ctf-figure.svg
:name: fig_ctf
Numerical and analytical results of the spectral signal to noise ratio for various phase retrieval techniques.
Derived functional forms are compared against experimental power spectra of biological crystals [@10.1038/s41467-024-52403-5].
